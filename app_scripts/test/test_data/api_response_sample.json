        "description": "<br><p><a href=\"https://www.dublab.com/shows/two-step-verification\">Two-Step Verification</a> exists as another entry into the world of <a href=\"https://www.dublab.com/djs/swami-sound\">Swami Sound</a>’s making. The show’s title was inspired by a tweet; which in turn began a mix series on Soundcloud; and further evolved into a curated playlist and rave series of the same name: all helped along by the artist’s addiction to the Internet. Swami enters 2023 with the ideal setting for his online brainbaby as a monthly radio slot on dublab. It’s a looksee of Swami Sound’s foray into the UK Garage/Two Step Genre with a scope turned on Internet discovery. The show engages the dance music community in whatever online niche Swami finds them in. His audience has widened as a result of consistently posting his mixes and music — whether it’s through the unique sound or sultry IDs that his crowds request persistently at his shows. With guest mixes, sound bites, and interviews by collaborators, curators, inspirations and the sort, Swami injects dublab’s feed with the very syncopated rhythms that have uploaded his musical career into a new realm while joyfully engaging with the people over the tempos of the Web.</p>",
